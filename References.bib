	abstract = {Minimum convex polygons (convex hulls) are an internationally accepted, standard method for estimating species’ ranges, particularly in circumstances in which presence-only data are the only kind of spatially explicit data available. One of their main strengths is their simplicity. They are used to make area statements and to assess trends in occupied habitat, and are an important part of the assessment of the conservation status of species. We show by simulation that these estimates are biased. The bias increases with sample size, and is affected by the underlying shape of the species habitat, the magnitude of errors in locations, and the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort. The errors affect both area statements and estimates of trends. Some of these errors may be reduced through the application of αhulls, which are generalizations of convex hulls, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. α-hulls provide an explicit means for excluding discontinuities within a species range. Strengths and weaknesses of alternatives including kernel estimators were examined. Convex hulls exhibit larger bias than α-hulls when used to quantify habitat extent and to detect changes in range, and when subject to differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort and spatial accuracy. α-hulls should be preferred for estimating the extent of and trends in species’ ranges.},

	abstract = {We review the use and ﬁndings of meta-analyses that link evolution to conservation. An initial search of the literature produced 606 studies that appeared to be relevant, 120 of which proved to be narrow-sense meta-analyses. Only 23 explicitly intersected evolution and conservation. Collectively these meta-analyses summarized the results of some 2,000 studies of *3,000 species. Most of the meta-analyses examined questions such as links between genetic variation and ﬁtness of individuals in small populations, genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation, and changes in traits in time and space in response to a variety of human impacts ranging from pollution to invasive species and climate change. By summarizing the results of large numbers of disparate studies, meta-analyses usually conﬁrmed theoretical expectations, but sometimes revealed that predicted relationships or differences are much weaker than conventionally assumed. They have also been helpful in pointing out beneﬁts and pitfalls of alternative methodologies and metrics. Other major areas of conservation concern such as impacts of overexploitation have been synthesized in other ways, but not yet by formal meta-analyses. We conclude that most of the meta-analyses that have been done so far are aimed more strongly toward advancing our understanding of evolution than of conservation. We remain hopeful that this tool will ﬁnd increasing use in new questions at the intersection of these ﬁelds, and be aimed more directly at providing diagnoses and prescriptions for action in the ﬁeld of conservation management.},
