# BrownBag-rmarkdown
This is a beginner rmarkdown tutorial prepared for the Smithsonian Carpentries Brown Bags.
It contains an _.Rmd_ file, and three types of output files (Word, PDF, and HTML).
You can open the _.Rmd_ file at the same time that any of the outputs while you read trough the tutorial.
That way you can see how the text or code looks in the rmarkdown file and also how it translates into the output file.

To showcase rmarkdown features, I compiled information from multiple sources:

* https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/how-to-read-this-book.html
* https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html
* https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html

Have fun! :)
